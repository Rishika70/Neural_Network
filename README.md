# Neural_Network_Projects

### This repository contains two projects related to neural networks: one for food classification using Fastai and another for breast cancer classification using TensorFlow. The projects are implemented in Google Colab and cover the entire pipeline from training to deployment.

## 1. Food Classification using Fastai
   
### Overview

This project focuses on training a neural network to classify images of food into two categories: samosa and hot and sour soup. The implementation uses the Fastai library, and the model is exported using the learn.export() function, saving it as 'export.pkl' by default.

### Instructions

The main notebook for training and exporting the model is named Food_Classification_Fastai.ipynb.
Open the notebook in Google Colab for an interactive environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model.
The trained model will be exported as 'export.pkl' for deployment.

## 2. Breast Cancer Classification using TensorFlow
   
### Overview

This project is focused on deep learning for breast cancer classification. It utilizes TensorFlow for building and training a neural network to classify breast cancer data.

### Instructions

The primary notebook for this project is Breast_Cancer_Classification_TensorFlow.ipynb.
Access the notebook in Google Colab for an interactive environment.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the breast cancer classification model.
The trained model can be used for making predictions on new data.
Note
Both projects are implemented in Google Colab notebooks to leverage its cloud-based computing power. Make sure to have a Google account and access to Google Colab for seamless execution. Additionally, ensure that the necessary datasets are available and properly configured as specified in the respective notebooks.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to these projects! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
