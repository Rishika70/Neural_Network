# Neural_Network_Projects

### This repository contains two projects related to neural networks: one for food classification using Fastai and another for breast cancer classification using TensorFlow. The projects are implemented in Google Colab and cover the entire pipeline from training to deployment.

1. Food Classification using Fastai
   
Overview

This project focuses on training a neural network to classify images of food into two categories: samosa and hot and sour soup. The implementation uses the Fastai library, and the model is exported using the learn.export() function, saving it as 'export.pkl' by default.

Instructions

The main notebook for training and exporting the model is named Food_Classification_Fastai.ipynb.
Open the notebook in Google Colab for an interactive environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model.
The trained model will be exported as 'export.pkl' for deployment.
